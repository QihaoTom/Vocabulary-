## The Human Side of Organizational Management
* Throught history, **friction** between upper management and the **proletariat** has been common. This friction, if not mitigated through proper leadership, can adversely influence the productivity and efficiency of an organization. Organizational leaders are responsible not only for overseeing operations but also for delegating authority. According to Mary Parker Follett in "The Giving of Orders", authority must be exercised in an impersonal fashion if a leader is to avoid being perceived as overly authoritative or obsequious, as both extremes are counterproductive. The notion of depersonalized orders originated from scientific management. The depersonalization of orders coincided with the notion that workers were like machines. Follett sought a way to reduce management-worker conflict, recognizing that negative behavioral responses are more likely to emerge with superiors who embrace an overly authoritative leadership style. More specifically, Follett wrote:
>What happens to a man, in a man, when an order is given in a disagreeable manner by foreman, head of department, his immediate superior at the store, bank or factory? The man addressed feels that his self-respect has been attacked, that one of his most inner sanctuaries is invaded. He loses his temper or becomes **sullen** or is on the defensive

## The Problem With the UN Veto Power | NowThis World
* though even the organization's **fiercest critics** admit it has done a lot of **good around**  
* The UN has also been accused of being **complicit**共谋 in corruption, **tangled in** bureaucracy, and increasingly **reactive rather than proactive** in adreesing the world's
* it's also been **accused of** failing to act to prevent **genocides**种族灭绝 in places including Rwanda, Bosnia, and Darfur, Sudan.
* totally powerless / get to exercise real power / UN Security Council's Permanent 5 members (P5) / Right to Veto / break down what the right to veto is / how its implementation has failed humanitarian crises around the world / sat down with someone 
* Do you see it that way?
* it's remained largely unchanged since its first meeting / the six principal organs of the UN / save succeeding generations from **the scourage of war** / carries the power to reject a resolution / sanctions against / have to vote in favor 赞成/ **negate their own interest 违背** ／ palestinian 巴勒斯坦 ／ the Gaza border加沙 ／ in favor of **occupying the power** / myanmar 缅甸 ／ **mass atrocities are being commited** 
* **this proposal has gained steam in recent years with major human rights groups calling on the Security Council to adopt th e measure**
* as a check and balance on foreign intervention / what consitute / expand its membership 
* the glaring lack of permanent representation / are aomong the popular contenders 竞争者 ／ are more open to expansion 
* it would take a whole lot of support to modify the UN Charter, and to get all P5 members to agree at the same time to restrict their own power.
* But despite of all its flaws, experts generally agree: the UN creates a vital space for diplomacy, mediation, and maintaining international peace.
* indisutbly helped save lives / maintain global order / make the necessary reforms to balance power among its members and adequately address / falling through tracks /

## Research Design
> **so that's how they get their names**
* **the term are widely used in research**
* **so implied in a model also is** the notion of a causal mechanism
* **there must be a way in which** X and Y are related
* **A process by which change in** X leads to change or produces change in Y
> so the notion of a causal mechaism **is a very important part of the process**.
> it's important to be clear about what the positive a negative relationship mean.
* **so if** the cause and crime is the effect and disorder is the independent variable, another key question
* **those sorts of actvities**, **signal that** people are not reporting things or monitoring the streets.
* **it could that** you may thinking about earnings 
* **maybe if you have more earnings, you can get an education certainly**
* **One of the causal effect that has is it increase your earning potentials**
> so if you have a high education **as opposed to** dropping out of high school, you expected to earn more.
* **If we are thinking about it in that way, eduation is the cause.** 
* what you may have thought of things like, if you have more education, you will have more skills.
* **your skills are rewarded** in the job market
* **you can leverage a kind of social capital**
* **and that sth actually**
> **people use those terms quite interchangeablely so you may hear them used in different ways**
* **so model does that for us**
> **there are two basic ways of represeting a theory using a model**
* **but in either case the model has variables in it**
* **We've looked at that in a sense already**
* **but the model importantly also includes relationships how are the variables connected to other variables**, in particular, how might they can be connected in a causal way**
* The certain causes that we are interested in such as polices have cetain effects in the world.
> we're **fundamentally interested in** casuse and effect relationships
* that's the most basic model in a sense
* if we assume that disorder is the cause of crime **by allowing more disorder to occur then it triggers crime** because people with more criminial intentions read those signals and commit more serious crime.
* is not a positive relationship **as in a sense that we value or want**
* that's hence the name positive
* if that's the pattern, then we would get this kind of scatter plot. 
* **foundations are increasingly using and visible logic models all over the field of public affairs**
* What **the usefulness of a logic model**
> a logic model helps communicate to design or logic of a program then the name logic model comes from the fact that they illustrate the logic of a program meaning the way in which a programs works
* but they also help identify performance indicators, often you need to monitor a tracker program
* you may discover ways in which the program ought to redesigned or improved.
> I hope you take out of this course that the skill take with you because I think it's a useful skills to have.
> you don't want to be overwhelmed with a lot of details and multiple activities going on at the same time  
* a program run by polic system, there are all kinds of initiatives and programs
> this is really sort of the essential building block of the work of public management.
* you'll typically find a program information about it on a press release that a rolled out 
* site visits / original grant applicants / assault rifles / small handguns / bringing the guns inward / bring the gun awareness to a lot of people / firearms / law-abiding citizens良民 ／ cause harm / fuel a small war / drawing tools / gun buyback programs / in the last strcutional video / **intervening variables** / insert tab / use these ovals to represnt variables and arrows represent the relationships / too informative / **paintbrush格式刷** ／ along with pathway路径 link ／**anchor these arrows** / logically consistent / multiply the segments of the path / label is **too vague** / confuse yourself / **fairly self-evident** 显而易见的 got enough detail / the longer leaps / don't automatically know / **cash incentive** / turn in their guns / social motivation / 
> the documentation that exists for program and interviewing people and that **may all be part of what goes into developing a logic model**
* we are gonna follow the advice that I gave there of starting by idetifying the outcome
* show more specifically how the program achieve the outcome
* we're also going to use the text box here to kind of label some of the relationships as being plus or minus
* so there is the gunback program as the indenpdent variablea is program and depedent variable is gun violence.
* how that can be thought of as a variable
* **what I would encourage you to think about is the notion of what's called a dummy variable. it's either you have a program or you don't have a program**
* is being coded by one then the program has a direction. Having a program is associated with less violence. 
* **sparse 空，简单**
> use that paintbrush to copy kind of your formatting
* I am gonna do that
> they move when you move the variables that turns out to be helpful later on as you start to come in as the diagram gets  more complex
> by thinking aobut how the program leads to the number of guns being reduced in the communtiy
> so we can kind of back up
* if you've done a good job of articulating the intervening variables then you shouldn't have a direct relationship left over
> so there needs to be endorsement to build awareness of the program and also the program has to have features to motivate people to participate
> I'm sure this program has a advertising public relations element to it so that I want to include this.
> I am not articulating a link that's already there necessarily
