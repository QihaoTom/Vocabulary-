## The Human Side of Organizational Management
* Throught history, **friction** between upper management and the **proletariat** has been common. This friction, if not mitigated through proper leadership, can adversely influence the productivity and efficiency of an organization. Organizational leaders are responsible not only for overseeing operations but also for delegating authority. According to Mary Parker Follett in "The Giving of Orders", authority must be exercised in an impersonal fashion if a leader is to avoid being perceived as overly authoritative or obsequious, as both extremes are counterproductive. The notion of depersonalized orders originated from scientific management. The depersonalization of orders coincided with the notion that workers were like machines. Follett sought a way to reduce management-worker conflict, recognizing that negative behavioral responses are more likely to emerge with superiors who embrace an overly authoritative leadership style. More specifically, Follett wrote:
>What happens to a man, in a man, when an order is given in a disagreeable manner by foreman, head of department, his immediate superior at the store, bank or factory? The man addressed feels that his self-respect has been attacked, that one of his most inner sanctuaries is invaded. He loses his temper or becomes **sullen** or is on the defensive

* But despite of all its flaws, experts generally agree: the UN creates a vital space for diplomacy, mediation, and maintaining international peace.

> **so that's how they get their names**

* **the term are widely used in research**
* **so implied in a model also is** the notion of a causal mechanism
* **there must be a way in which** X and Y are related
* **A process by which change in** X leads to change or produces change in Y
* so the notion of a causal mechaism **is a very important part of the process**.
* **so if** the cause and crime is the effect and disorder is the independent variable, another key question
* **those sorts of actvities**, **signal that** people are not reporting things or monitoring the streets.
* **it could that** you may thinking about earnings 
* **maybe if you have more earnings, you can get an education certainly**
* **One of the causal effect that has is it increase your earning potentials**
* so if you have a high education **as opposed to** dropping out of high school, you expected to earn more.
* **If we are thinking about it in that way, eduation is the cause.** 
* what you may have thought of things like, if you have more education, you will have more skills.
* **your skills are rewarded** in the job market
* **you can leverage a kind of social capital**
* **and that sth actually**

* **so model does that for us**
* **there are two basic ways of represeting a theory using a model**
* **but in either case the model has variables in it**
* **We've looked at that in a sense already**
* **but the model importantly also includes relationships how are the variables connected to other variables**, in particular, how might they can be connected in a causal way**
* The certain causes that we are interested in such as polices have cetain effects in the world.
* we're **fundamentally interested in** casuse and effect relationships
* that's the most basic model in a sense
