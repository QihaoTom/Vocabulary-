## The Human Side of Organizational Management
* Throught history, **friction** between upper management and the **proletariat** has been common. This friction, if not mitigated through proper leadership, can adversely influence the productivity and efficiency of an organization. Organizational leaders are responsible not only for overseeing operations but also for delegating authority. According to Mary Parker Follett in "The Giving of Orders", authority must be exercised in an impersonal fashion if a leader is to avoid being perceived as overly authoritative or obsequious, as both extremes are counterproductive. The notion of depersonalized orders originated from scientific management. The depersonalization of orders **coincided with** the notion that workers were like machines. Follett sought a way to reduce management-worker conflict, recognizing that negative behavioral responses are more likely to emerge with superiors who embrace an overly authoritative leadership style. More specifically, Follett wrote:
>What happens to a man, in a man, when an order is given in a disagreeable manner by foreman, head of department, his immediate superior at the store, bank or factory? The man addressed feels that his self-respect has been attacked, that one of his most inner sanctuaries is invaded. He loses his temper or becomes **sullen** or is on the defensive

### Theory and Model
> **so that's how they get their names**
* **the term are widely used in research**
* **so implied in a model also is** the notion of a causal mechanism
* **there must be a way in which** X and Y are related
* **A process by which change in** X leads to change or produces change in Y
> so the notion of a causal mechaism **is a very important part of the process**.
> it's important to be clear about what the positive a negative relationship mean.
* **so if** the cause and crime is the effect and disorder is the independent variable, another key question
* **those sorts of actvities**, **signal that** people are not reporting things or monitoring the streets.
* **it could that** you may thinking about earnings 
* **maybe if you have more earnings, you can get an education certainly**
* **One of the causal effect that has is it increase your earning potentials**
> so if you have a high education **as opposed to** dropping out of high school, you expected to earn more.
* **If we are thinking about it in that way, eduation is the cause.** 
* what you may have thought of things like, if you have more education, you will have more skills.
* **your skills are rewarded** in the job market
* **you can leverage a kind of social capital**
* **and that sth actually**
> **people use those terms quite interchangeablely so you may hear them used in different ways**
* **so model does that for us**
> **there are two basic ways of represeting a theory using a model**
* **but in either case the model has variables in it**
* **We've looked at that in a sense already**
* **but the model importantly also includes relationships how are the variables connected to other variables**, in particular, how might they can be connected in a causal way**
* The certain causes that we are interested in such as polices have cetain effects in the world.
> we're **fundamentally interested in** casuse and effect relationships
* that's the most basic model in a sense
* if we assume that disorder is the cause of crime **by allowing more disorder to occur then it triggers crime** because people with more criminial intentions read those signals and commit more serious crime.
* is not a positive relationship **as in a sense that we value or want**
* that's hence the name positive
* if that's the pattern, then we would get this kind of scatter plot. 
* **foundations are increasingly using and visible logic models all over the field of public affairs**
* What **the usefulness of a logic model**
> a logic model helps communicate to design or logic of a program then the name logic model comes from the fact that they illustrate the logic of a program meaning the way in which a programs works
* but they also help identify performance indicators, often you need to monitor a tracker program
* you may discover ways in which the program ought to redesigned or improved.
> I hope you take out of this course that the skill take with you because I think it's a useful skills to have.
> you don't want to be overwhelmed with a lot of details and multiple activities going on at the same time  
* a program run by polic system, there are all kinds of initiatives and programs
> this is really sort of the essential building block of the work of public management.
* you'll typically find a program information about it on a press release that a rolled out 
* site visits / original grant applicants / assault rifles / small handguns / bringing the guns inward / bring the gun awareness to a lot of people / firearms / law-abiding citizens良民 ／ cause harm / fuel a small war / drawing tools / gun buyback programs / in the last strcutional video / **intervening variables** / insert tab / use these ovals to represnt variables and arrows represent the relationships / too informative / **paintbrush格式刷** ／ along with pathway路径 link ／**anchor these arrows** / logically consistent / multiply the segments of the path / label is **too vague** / confuse yourself / **fairly self-evident** 显而易见的 got enough detail / the longer leaps / don't automatically know / **cash incentive** / turn in their guns / social motivation / 
> the documentation that exists for program and interviewing people and that **may all be part of what goes into developing a logic model**
* we are gonna follow the advice that I gave there of starting by idetifying the outcome
* show more specifically how the program achieve the outcome
* we're also going to use the text box here to kind of label some of the relationships as being plus or minus
* so there is the gunback program as the indenpdent variablea is program and depedent variable is gun violence.
* how that can be thought of as a variable
* **what I would encourage you to think about is the notion of what's called a dummy variable. it's either you have a program or you don't have a program**
* is being coded by one then the program has a direction. Having a program is associated with less violence. 
* **sparse 空，简单**
> use that paintbrush to copy kind of your formatting
* I am gonna do that
> they move when you move the variables that turns out to be helpful later on as you start to come in as the diagram gets  more complex
> by thinking aobut how the program leads to the number of guns being reduced in the communtiy
> so we can kind of back up
* if you've done a good job of articulating the intervening variables then you shouldn't have a direct relationship left over
> so there needs to be endorsement to build awareness of the program and also the program has to have features to motivate people to participate
> I'm sure this program has a advertising public relations element to it so that I want to include this.
> I am not articulating a link that's already there necessarily

### Qualiatative Research
* because it they play a role **throughout** the research process.
* and it helps **integrate** both a quantitative and a qualitative research perspective as we move later topics.
* how analysis works **a bit of that**
* a few ethical issues that are unique to qualitative research
> Quantitative research may be **oversimplifies** things it **redueces rich detail of social life** into numerical measures.
* too simplistic / the criticism of the qualitative / rigorous and scientific / subjective interpretation / asscociated with advances in stats and community computing / over the quantification of social research / but in many ways / to have a bit of both / **triangualtion** / fit together / illustrate the idea / to begin with an exploratory phase of research which tends to be mostly qualitative / on the ground observations / data collection effort / sort of a loop here / feed each other in a kind of sequential pattern / fit more than / developing theory, build models, and generating theories / **a real dstinct advantage of qualitative research** / useful for uncovering causal processes or mechanisms / rapid reconnaissance / miss important breaking events / good at / **group dynamics** / it's a better method / **good example national archival** **testimony** legislative debates, strategic plans, correspondance 往来函件 political, administrative activity /  research often turn to to understand policies and program and social affairs / popular media, visual media culture / analyze the guilt or innocence of the caller who is reporting crime / ethnography 民族志 ／ check the box / is typical of surveys / **probe** 调查 ／ journalistic or open-ended sytle / two **broad types** / wholly or completely unstructed interviews / tend to take place / more fluid 随性 ／ improvisational 即兴的／ it's an inner group interview of a group of people in which there's a moderator who's somebody is the interviewer / sort of a oval or circular table / so participants **cue each other** /  brainstorm session /  lively and insightful discussion / **generalizability** / **hindrance** 障碍 ／ socially embarrassing topic you wouldn't want to cover that in a focus group with people / little sylized diagram / distribute the discussion,call on people / regulate people who may be dominating the discussion too much / they have benn listening the whole time and they may catch things that the moderator misses / **feed** people, appreciate a little food and refreshments / **unobtrusive** 不唐突 ／ reveal a lot / can suggest insight /  hepatitis 肝炎 ／ intensive form / observe a community / anthropology 人类学／ a neighborhood **precinct** 选取 ／ **paradigmatic** case 典型 ／ at most a couple cases / consideration / a particular kind of something that we're interested in / particular unsuccessful / let's say / that's somehow critical in another way / case study is often **comparative** in a comparative study / we compare two schools / set up a an analytical comparison /  provides a lot of **leverage** / **tabulation** or calcuation / raw qualitative data / categorizing the meaning or the sentences or the **utterance** that are in the document through a process of coding / either in narrative form quotes, selected quotes / the analysis of data along with the gathering of data typically in quanatitative research / a bit more **intertwined** / **iterative**反反复复 **an iteration** ／ **refinement**提炼 of the topic / **cyclical pattern** / understanding of this setting or of the behavior / reach a point of **saturation** where you've discovered what you need to discover饱和 ／ **crux**关键 ／ classifying / **so essentially** / part of the text that illustrate a particular idea or theme or topic / count, sort / **incorporate** websites, documents / demonstration videos / time-consuming / transcribed 转录 / **disguise** 掩盖 ／ informed consent 知情同意 ／ in the setting / partly because / direct and personal **involvement** / enhace **obligation** / **empower** / 
> this is a fairly long debate, it goes back to the origins of the social sciences whch began more qualitatively with more interpretive methods
> and then there was a qualitative push back in the 70s.
> they are ways in which they work well together that in some ways the best approach is some combination of quantitative and qualitative methods that's sometimes referred to as mixed methods approach.
> evidence is from several sources gives you a better feel for what might be real and true about a situation.
> The idea that several sources data when they converge on a finding, it offers more proofor more come from confirmation.
> **then you're in a better position to do** more systematic quantitative research **which gets us to the second phase**
* we want to **expand our coverage**, look at a broader population **take a more representative sample**, to do a survey
> focus group to try to **shed light on** what our survey finds that may lead to some new ideas new variables new hypotheses.
* so that's one way in which both methods are part of invesigating a social problem or a social policy or managament issue often begin with qualitative research to understand what's going on using that information to design a more systematic quantitative data collectino effort **but then in turn** suggests new questions that may have to be investigated qualitatively.
> Often there's an assistant moderator either off to the side or perhaps somewhere else in the room who's obersering and cooperting with the moderator.
> So there's this process of starting with some additional questions gathering data in the process, analyzing and refining the questions, gathering more data, further refining the questions and so on,
> the aim is to try to understand a situation to understand people, orgranzation or whatever.
> you're learning as you're doing the interviews which influnences further interviews
